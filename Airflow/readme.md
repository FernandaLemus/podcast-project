## About this pipeline

I ran this process in the workspace of data pipelines with Airflow project. I made sure everything ran without errors. 

The tables were created directly in redshift and the reference is in the create_tables.sq file.

My s3 bucket remains public in case you want to see the datasets I worked with (which I took from Kaggle).

After successfully running the process, I eliminated the cluster that held the information.
